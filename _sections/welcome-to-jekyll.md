Lil bit throwback here. Started playing back in highschool, most of us dont have our own pc so every weekend we play at the cybercafe together, it was fun, spent the whole day playing DoTA, sometimes from 10am to 4pm, 6 hours straight. We would fight with other dota teams in our school and even joined a tournament once, we lost in the first stage obviously but was worth it. Finished highschool and all of us went our different ways, some took up csgo, or mobile legend, or fornite, or just stopped playing cause we are so busy. It's hard to have party as great as those guys. I still play sometimes, for nostalgia sake.
