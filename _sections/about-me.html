<p>A full-time student in Bachelor of Engineering Technology(Hons) in Computer Systems. GitHub is an open-source repository hosting service, sort of like a cloud for code. It hosts your source code projects in a variety of different programming languages and keeps track of the various changes made to every iteration. Using GitHub makes it easier to collaborate with colleagues and peers and look back at previous versions of your work.Fortunately, when you post your project on GitHub, the wider community of programmers and hobbyists can download and evaluate your work. They can give you a heads-up on possible issues such as conflicts or unforeseen dependency issues.
