<font color="black">Step 1: Configure MSCONFIG in Windows 10</font>

- Type on Search (on window taskbar)-> <strong>msconfig</strong> and click on it .
- Select Services tab -> Tick “Hide All Microsoft Services” .
- Then remove anything you think unnecessary to be there. For example, “Firefox Update”, “Chrome Update” or “Google Update” services.
- Do not worry you can just disable them by Tick-ing on the left side of it.
- Thus, click Apply.

<font color="black">Step 3: Check if your Computer is Infected by Virus</font>

- Imo, the most reliable (at the moment) and free antivirus to scan your computer system is Malwarebytes.
- Free Download (no commission tho) -> http://www.malwarebytes.com
- Remember this is for scanning and virus removal only ( real time protection needs premium account).
- You guys can install Avast or Smadav free antivirus software. ( Currently I’m using Avast).
- Next, if you guys experiencing situation below then you should install Adwcleaner. (http://www.malwarebytes.com/adwcleaner )

<font color="black">Step 4 : Adding more RAMS</font>
- Check your total amount of computer’s RAM -> Go to task manager and click Performance tab.
- Then, take a look at the RAM resource under Memory.

- If you guys having total amount of RAM below 2GB, then I would highly recommend to upgrade them to have at least 8GB for smoother experience (especially tabbing in Chrome).
- How to upgrade RAM ? -> download here downloadmoreram.com (scam jk)
- You need to check your RAM slot in your computer first. If there are empty slots or you may do replacement to the old ones ( check your RAM type eg. ddr3, ddr4).
- If you guys are inexperienced in doing this, then you should get some help from knowledgeable person.

<font color="black">Step 5: The Ultimate Upgrade for your Computer ( SSD) Get Ready for Zoommm!</font>

- Are you using normal hard disk ? eww are u from 1950s pc users lmao
- Upgrade your hard disk by installing SSD in your computer ( Make it as main C partition).
- Buy from here <font color="blue"><a href="url">https://shopee.com.my</a></font> -> ( search ‘SSD’ )
- When you had it, install the SSD inside your laptop/pc. You might want to replace your old hard disk if you don’t have any hard disk slot left.
- For normal laptop, there is 99% chance that your laptop has only 1 hard disk slot. And you still want to use your old hard disk at the same time.
- Do not worry, if you guys not actually using the DVD drive ( located at the side of laptop), then you guys able to take its slot to install the SSD.
- In order to do that, a ‘disk caddy’ must be used. See image below.

- For new/high end laptop, there is more likely that your laptop has M.2 Slot ( for M.2 type SSD). So you are able to use your old hard disk and new SSD (M.2) at the same time.
- If you need more guidance in doing this (yes you should tho) , get some help or you may contact me.

For now, i’m using this SSD for my laptop (yes it does zoommm!)
