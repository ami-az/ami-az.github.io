**These are the quick and simple steps on how to troubleshoot and to achieve improvements (faster computer bootup and efficiency).**

<b><u>Step 1: Configure MSCONFIG in Windows 10</u></b>

- Type on Search (on window taskbar)-> <strong>msconfig</strong> and click on it .
- Select Services tab -> Tick “Hide All Microsoft Services” .
- Then remove anything you think unnecessary to be there. For example, “Firefox Update”, “Chrome Update” or “Google Update” services.
- Do not worry you can just disable them by Tick-ing on the left side of it.
- Thus, click Apply.

<u>Step 3: Check if your Computer is Infected by Virus</u>

- Imo, the most reliable (at the moment) and free antivirus to scan your computer system is Malwarebytes.
- Free Download (no commission tho) -> http://www.malwarebytes.com
- Remember this is for scanning and virus removal only ( real time protection needs premium account).
- You guys can install Avast or Smadav free antivirus software. ( Currently I’m using Avast).
- Next, if you guys experiencing situation below then you should install Adwcleaner. (http://www.malwarebytes.com/adwcleaner )

- Then, take a look at the RAM resource under Memory.
