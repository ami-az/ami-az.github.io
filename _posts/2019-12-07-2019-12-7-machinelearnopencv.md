<h3>Bicycle Detection using Haar Cascade in OpenCV</h3>

<br>This segment will explain the specific procedures and techniques of my mini project which titled Bicycle Detection by using Haar Cascades features in OpenCV and how to implement it in the real-world environment.

<br>Below are the steps and configurations in Ubuntu System including OpenCV and Python3 binding which have been installed properly.
1) Three folders were created which named data, positives and negatives in a directory.
2) 391 images of bicycles were put into positives folder, 4719 images of non-related to bicycle were put into negatives folder, while data folder was set empty.
3) Then train the cascade using the provided commands and annotate the positive images.
4) The sample was created and trained (Figure 3.1).
5) Cascade.xml which was created by the training process is put in the directory of the python program file.
