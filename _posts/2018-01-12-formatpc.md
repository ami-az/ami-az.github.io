<font color="maroon">Format your laptop/computer using the simplest ways!.</font>

First thing first, what you will need :-
- Pendrive 8GB
- Internet connection

Here we start :-
<br>1) Download the windows 10 iso at official website -> <font color="blue"><a href="url">https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/software-download/windows10</a></font>

2) On the website, we are not going to use the download tool (bcs its slow). Instead, use this way -> <font color="blue"><a href="url"> https://www.howtogeek.com/427223/how-to-download-a-windows-10-iso-without-the-media-creation-tool/ </a></font>
  
3) After downloaded the windows iso, you need to "install the iso" into your 8GB pendrive.
  
4) To "install the iso", must use rufus tool. Download here -> <font color="blue"><a href="url">https://github.com/pbatard/rufus/releases/download/v3.8/rufus-3.8.exe</a></font>
  
5) Open the rufus tool. (Warning this will erase your all pendrive's files)
- From the Device drop-down menu, select your USB drive, if it isn't automatically selected.
- Under "Boot selection", select Disk or ISO image (Please select), if it isn't already chosen, and then click SELECT to choose the .iso file you downloaded.
- Leave "Image option" set to Standard Windows installation.
- Leave "Partition scheme" set to GPT.
- For "Target system", select UEFI (non CSM).
- Under "Format Options", to ensure the flash drive is compatible with UEFI, select NTFS for "File System".
- To create the flash drive with the "Press any key to boot from USB" prompt at startup, under the "Advanced format" options, select Create extended label and icon files.
- When you are finished selecting options, click Start. When prompted, confirm that you want to erase the flash disk.
- The .iso files will start copying to the flash drive; the process can take several minutes. When Rufus is done, close the program and eject and remove the flash drive.
  
6) Your pendrive is now ready to be used to format your pc. Restart the laptop/pc and change the boot order.
  
7) To change the boot order, you need to enter the system bios. There are several ways doing this but i will show you the easiest one. Here below.

<u>How to Enter the BIOS on Windows 10</u>
- Go to Settings (Windows + I) > Update & Security > Recovery and under Advanced startup click
  Restart now. Note that this will actually restart your computer.

- When you restart using advanced startup, youâ€™ll first get to choose your boot options. On the screen that comes up, go to <font color="maroon">Troubleshoot > Advanced options > UEFI Firmware Settings</font> and click Restart, which will boot straight into your UEFI BIOS from Windows 10.
  
- If you facing issue like there is no UEFI Firmware Settings, you might want enter the bios using alternative way (using keyboard keys). Do refer here -> <font color="blue"><a href="url">https://www.makeuseof.com/tag/enter-bios-computer/</a></font>
  
   <span class="image center"><img src="{{ 'assets/images/uefifirmware.png' | relative_url }}" alt="" /></span>
  
- After the pc restarted, the screen will jump straight to the bios. Which you will be able to change the boot order there. Change the boot order (make it to 1st Option in list) -> Choose your 8GB Pendrive

- If you guys having issue when doing this as your bios setting maybe has different setting. Kindly refer here -> <font color="blue"><a href="url">https://www.asus.com/support/FAQ/1008277/</a></font>

8) Save the settings and restart your computer. When booting, the screen will prompt the user to "press any key to boot" from your pendrive (just press any key) and wait for the setup screen to appear (take a while).

9) The windows installation setup is now ready. Complete the installation process by choosing the correct disk (partition C) for main system file.
