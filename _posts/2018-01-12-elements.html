<font color="maroon">Format your laptop/computer using the simplest ways!.</font>

<br>First thing first, what you will need :-
<br>- Pendrive 8GB
<br>- Internet connection

<br>Here we start :-
<br>1) Download the windows 10 iso at official website -> <font color="blue"><a href="url">https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/software-download/windows10</font>

<br>2) On the website, we are not going to use the download tool (bcs its slow). Instead, use this way -> <font color="blue"><a href="url"> https://www.howtogeek.com/427223/how-to-download-a-windows-10-iso-without-the-media-creation-tool/ </font>
  
<br>3) After downloaded the windows iso, you need to "install the iso" into your 8GB pendrive.
  
<br>4) To "install the iso", must use rufus tool. Download here -> <font color="blue"><a href="url">https://github.com/pbatard/rufus/releases/download/v3.8/rufus-3.8.exe</font>
  
<br>5) Open the rufus tool. 
 <br> - From the Device drop-down menu, select your USB drive, if it isn't automatically selected.
  
<br> - Under "Boot selection", select Disk or ISO image (Please select), if it isn't already chosen, and then click SELECT to choose the .iso file you downloaded.
<br> - Leave "Image option" set to Standard Windows installation.
<br> - Leave "Partition scheme" set to GPT.
<br> - For "Target system", select UEFI (non CSM).
<br> - Under "Format Options", to ensure the flash drive is compatible with UEFI, select FAT32 for "File System".
<br> - To create the flash drive with the "Press any key to boot from USB" prompt at startup, under the "Advanced format" options, select Create extended label and icon files.
<br> - When you are finished selecting options, click Start. When prompted, confirm that you want to erase the flash disk.
<br> - The .iso files will start copying to the flash drive; the process can take several minutes. When Rufus is done, close the program and eject and remove the flash drive.
